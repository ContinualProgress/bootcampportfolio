1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

2. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?

### Please post your answer here. Please use your own words and do it within 50 words for each question.


1)  git fetch retrieves changes from a remote WITHOUT copying those changes to the current working directory, while git pull retrieves and copies the 
    changes to the working directory.


2)  The staging designates those files that will be logged in the very next commit.
